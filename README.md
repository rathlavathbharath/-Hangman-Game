# Hangman-Game
Welcome to my Hangman game project! This Python-based game challenges players to guess a hidden word letter by letter before running out of lives. If players guess the word within the limit, they win. Otherwise, they lose.The project is designed to be interactive and engaging, allowing users to experience the classic Hangman game in a digital format.

How It Works:

1. The game starts by randomly selecting a word from a predefined list of words.
2. Players are presented with a visual representation of the Hangman's gallows and a set number of lives.
3. Players input their guesses for letters one at a time.
4. The game provides feedback on whether the guessed letter is correct or not.
5. The guessed letters are displayed, helping players see their progress.
6. If the guessed letter is correct, it's filled into the corresponding positions in the hidden word.
7. If the guessed letter is incorrect, a life is deducted, and part of the Hangman is drawn.
8. Players continue guessing until they either correctly guess the entire word or run out of lives.
9. The game ends with a victory message if the word is guessed correctly, or a defeat message if lives are exhausted.
